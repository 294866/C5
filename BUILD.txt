BUILDING THE C5 GENERIC COLLECTION LIBRARY FOR C#/CLI
Updated 2011-04-23

The C5 library can be built by opening the solution file C5.sln in the
current directory with Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 or Microsoft
Visual C# 2010 Express Edition and performing a Build All.

Or execute 'msbuild C5.sln' from the command line in this directory.

This will build C5 in file C5/bin/Release/C5.dll 

Building all in the C5.sln solution will also build these projects:

  * The 'UserGuideExample' project compiles the examples from chapter
    11 of the technical report ITU-TR-2006-76

  * The 'C5.Tests' project compiles the unit tests but does not run them;
    see below.  An enormous number of compilation errors will result
    unless you have NUnit 2 installed.  The project is configured for
    NUnit version 2.5.9 and was tested with that version.

The build should complete with a few dozen compilation warnings.

Generating the online documentation

Documentation can be built using Sandcastle (http://sandcastle.codeplex.com/)
along with Sandcastle Help File Builder (http://shfb.codeplex.com/)

Running the NUnit tests

Prerequisites:

 * You must have NUnit installed (version 2.5.x). 

 * The C5.Tests project (C5.Tests/C5.Tests.csproj) must include a reference to
   to the installed nunit.framework.dll.  Add the reference by
   right-clicking "References" under "nunit" in Visual Studio's
   Solution Explorer.

Steps to build and run unit tests:

 * Build the project called "C5.Tests".  

 * Start NUnit, select File > Open > nunit/bin/Debug/nunit.dll, or
   simply double-click nunit/bin/Debug/nunit.dll

 * Press Run in the NUnit user interface

There are more than 1437 NUnit test cases which should execute in less
than 30 seconds.  All should pass when C5 is built in Debug mode.

Note: The Release builds of C5 use randomized hashing for efficiency,
whereas the Debug builds use deterministic hashing to simplify
testing.  This means that approximately 13 hashtable test cases will
fail (harmlessly) when C5 is built and tested in Release mode, using
File > Open > nunit/bin/Release/nunit.dll
